      Web3 is the best thing to happen to the internet since it started.
      Reinstating power at the hands of the masses. But, we can do even better.
      <br />
      The true 'iPhone moment' 📱 of NFTs still remains to be discovered.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      So, in a jungle of pfp-NFTs and kinda irksome "Just took a screenshot of
      your $2000 NFT" peeps, we got the inspiration to try to do something
      different.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      4TheMetaverse is a giant NFT project on Polygon. A digital canvas with
      100,000 pixels. Every owner of a token will be able to decide the color of
      the pixel of the same number, a message to go along with it and a link of
      something they'd like to inroduce the world to.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      Imagine the Svalbard Global Seed Vault but for human consciousness, and
      that's what we want $4TM to be. A sign of how different and diverse we all are
      and still capable of great things when we work together. 💪
    </p>

    <p class="text-xs pb-12">How we think the canvas is going to look.</p>
    <p class="pb-18 text-xl">
      Each token will cost ______ (you decide!) to mint. We would be happy for
      any amount above 1 Matic, as we want NFTs to be accessible to everyone,
      regardless of their purchasing power. 😇 Also, anyone will be able to buy
      20 tokens at max.
    </p>

          After 100% of the tokens get sold, each pixel’s metadata (only
          inlcuding the color) will be pinned to IPFS, so that secondary sales
          can start properly.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-6">
          A Merch Store will be opened. A community wallet will be made with 50%
          of the revenue from the mint. And all the proceeds from secondary
          sales will end up there.

          A collection of arts depicting the whole revolution of web3 will be
          launched. Each and every one will be 1/1 and hand-drawn fully with the
          community being able to decide which events need to be depicted. Each
          will cost X.XETH to mint. The physical art piece will be framed and
          delivered to the buyer. Again, 50% of the profits will go to the
          community wallet.

          The $4TM DAO, along with the community wallet will decide the future
          direction of this project. Buy some land? Fund community’s favourite
          web3 projects? Spend to increase crypto literacy? Invest in promising
          NFTs and Cryptocurrencies? Possibilities are endless, as they should
          be.
