      We caught the Web3 fever late (like early-2021 late). Then, we saw all the
      spots in the cool clubs were taken. We were not cool enough to get offered
      a spot, or were (still are) loaded enough to pay for the atrocious txn
      fees.

    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      So, we were like fuck it, let's build one our own.

    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      Web3 is the best thing to happen to the internet since it started.
      Reinstating power at the hands of the masses. But, we can do even better.

      4TheMetaverse is a giant NFT project on Polygon. A digital canvas with
      100,000 pixels. Every owner of a token will be able to decide the color of
      the pixel of the same number and a message to go along with it. A sign of
      how different and diverse we all are and still capable of great things
      when we work together. ðŸ’ª

          After 100% of the tokens get sold, each pixelâ€™s metadata will be
          pinned to IPFS and frozen forever. Secondary sale will start on
          OpenSea.

          A Merch Store will be opened. A community wallet will be opened with
          50% of the revenue from the mint. And all the proceeds from secondary
          sales will end up there.
