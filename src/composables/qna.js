    question:
      "So bro, you talked a lot about inclusion, but what happens when all tokens get sold and still more people want to get in?",
    answer: "Can always increase the number of pixels.",

    question: "Why not make these NFT’s fully free tho?",
    answer:
      "We want to give the feeling of investing and paying for something to the people, without making them burn their pockets. For a whole-ass token (1 Matic), you get a whole-ass NFT, and that’s pretty cool.",

    question:
      "How would you want the community to take shape as? What’s your vision bro?",
    answer:
      "Before this, we worked on 3 different projects. None worked out just because we didn’t have the distribution. So, regardless of everything, we want this community to be like having 100,000 followers for each and everyone, helping each other always.",

    question:
      "Why you ain’t launching on Ethereum? That’s the place to be, isn’t it?",
    answer:
      "Love Ethereum ❤️. But, we’d rather accept Mastercard than make people pay over $50 equivalent of ETH for just sending a txn.",

    id: "faq_question_5",
    question:
      "Are you actually selling 100,000 tokens fr? Or would you reserve some?",
    answer:
      "We will reserve some. 500 to be exact. A bunch will be distributed to get the word out. Majority will be reserved for inviting people from other walks of life, who are still not fully into crypto. As there is no rarity ‘trait’ in tokens, We will conveniently reserve tokens 0 to 499",

    question: "Where will be the metadata stored related to each pixel?",
    answer:
      "On the chain itself! You would get only one chance to chuck in your quote and color, so be careful!",
  },
  {
    id: "faq_question_7",
    question:
      "Gotta address the elephant in the room now. What benefits do I get to be a part of this?",
    answer:
      "Along with everything said on the roadmap, you get complete control and right over the pixel you mint. You decide the color and quote on it. Let’s say you have a way with your words, and we want to print your quote on the merch, you can ask for royalties. Apart from that, anything you’re working on, you’re free to showcase that in front of everyone and also collaborate with anyone in the community.",
