      Web3 is the best thing to happen to the internet since it started.
      Reinstating power at the hands of the masses. But, we can do even better.
      <br />
      The true 'iPhone moment' 📱 of NFTs still remains to be discovered.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      So, in a jungle of pfp-NFTs and kinda irksome "Just took a screenshot of
      your $2000 NFT" peeps, we got the inspiration to try to do something
      different.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      4TheMetaverse is a giant NFT project on Polygon. A digital canvas with
      100,000 pixels. Every owner of a token will be able to choose a pixel. Then decide the color of it, a message to go along with it and a link of
      something they'd like to introduce the world to. Which can be a Spotify Playlist, or the cool project that you've been working on or anything in between!!
    </p>
    <p class="pb-12 text-xl">
      Imagine the Global Seed Vault but for human consciousness, and
      that's what we want $4TM to be. A sign of how different and diverse we all are
      and still capable of great things when we come together. 💪

    <p class="text-xs pb-12">How we think the canvas is going to look.</p>
    <p class="pb-18 text-xl">
      Each token will cost .... (We are still deciding).⌛️ Anyone will be able to buy
      20 tokens at max.

          A Merch Store will be opened. 70% of profits will always go to a community wallet. A DAO will be established to manage the resource allocation. We are curious to see what decisions the community will make.

          A collection of arts depicting the whole revolution of web3 will be
          launched. Each and every one will be 1/1 and hand-drawn fully with the
          community being able to decide which events need to be depicted. Each
          will cost X.XETH to mint. The physical art piece will be framed and
          delivered to the buyer.

          A Decentralised link-manager. Why? Firstly, we believe both the projects are similar in several aspects and secondly, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sex-workers-linktree-ban" class="text-[#8249E4]" target="_blank">this.</a> For this project we will launch $4TM ERC-20 token to incentivise early adopters and several other cool stuff we have in mind. And if you hold a $4TM NFT, you will always be getting the best stuff first. 🎊
